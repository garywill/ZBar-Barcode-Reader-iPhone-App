App Support Forum
=================

The primary support channel for this app is the `ZBar iPhone App Forum`_.  If
you need help, have a question or comment, or just want to tell us about how
you use the app, feel free to post in the forum - we love to hear from all our
users!

.. _`ZBar iPhone App Forum`:
   https://sourceforge.net/projects/zbar/forums/forum/1072194#reply

Tips for posting:

* Add a new topic (form at the bottom of the page) for your question.
  *Please* do not "hijack" an existing thread.

* Be patient - Someone will respond, but it may take a few days if things are
  busy.

* If you do not "monitor" the topic or subscribe to the RSS feed, you will not
  know when a response is posted.

* Keep in mind that we give you this app for free; entitled requests will not
  be well received.

.. important::

   Do not email support questions directly to the developers!  While we
   appreciate hearing from you, we simply don't have the resources to give
   each user free, personalized support.  Post your question in the forum
   where others can respond or benefit from the responses.

Feature Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   "It would be great if the app [worked like this]..."

   "Will you add [my favorite feature]?"

We do appreciate all feedback, including your suggestions and feature
requests, and these are certainly taken into account as the app evolves.  Of
course, we can't promise anything - just because you propose a feature does
not imply that we are committed to work on it.


Development Services
====================

If you have a specific mobile app need and a realistic development budget, we
do offer custom development services.  Some possibilities from our previous
experience:

* Re-branded ZBar app with fixed, predefined links.
* Customizations to the ZBar app.
* A completely new app designed to your specifications.

Contact `ZBar Consulting \<info@zbar-consulting.com>`_ with your inquiry and
we'll be happy to discuss your project with you.
