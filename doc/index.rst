  ZBar iPhone App
###################

Welcome to the ZBar app!  This :doc:`open source <license>` application is a
demonstration of the ZBar Barcode Reader library running on iOS platforms.  

.. important::

   This app *only* works with the iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4.  Apologies to other
   iOS users, but this barcode scanner is not designed to work with the poor
   quality camera found on your device [*]_.

   .. [*] The iPad may be supported in a future version of the app.

.. important::

   This is not a "shopping app"!  It's just about scanning many different
   kinds of barcodes and creating links based on the data.

Using this app you can:

* Scan many different barcode formats: EAN-13/UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN-8, Code 128,
  Code 93, Code 39, Interleaved 2 of 5, DataBar, DataBar Expanded and QR Code.
* Search for products using Google, Amazon and the Internet UPC Database
* ...or define your own searches.
* Scan QR codes containing URLs and link directly to the web site.
* Scan QR codes containing an E-mail address and send mail.
* Scan tracking numbers and track packages with UPS and FedEx.
* Maintain lists of scanned barcodes.
* Send an E-mail with a list of barcodes attached as a CSV spreadsheet.
* Cut and paste barcode data into other apps.
