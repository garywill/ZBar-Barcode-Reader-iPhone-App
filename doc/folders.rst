  The Folder List
*******************

Once you accumulate a lot of barcodes, it will be difficult to find them in
one long listing.  To help with this, you can organize your barcodes into
"folders", or separate lists of barcodes.  To work with folders, navigate to
the folder list, by tapping back on the "Folders" button from any barcode
list.

Tap a folder to view the :doc:`list of barcodes <barcodes>` it contains.


.. _current-folder:

The Current Folder
==================

.. list-table::
   :widths: 1 99
   :class: imglist

   * - |folder icon|
     - When you open the :doc:`barcode scanner <scanning>`, any barcodes you
       scan will be filed in the *current folder*.  This is simply the folder
       that you are currently working in.  Select a different folder to change
       where your barcodes are filed as you scan them.


.. _add-folder:

Adding New Folders
==================

.. list-table::
   :widths: 1 99
   :class: imglist

   * - |plus icon|
     - New folders are added from the folder list: tap the plus '+' icon in
       the toolbar, then enter a name for the new folder and tap "Save".

The new folder name defaults to the current date and time.  If you're in a
hurry, just use this - you can always change the name later if you want.


Renaming Folders
================

.. list-table::
   :widths: 1 99
   :class: imglist

   * - |edit icon|
     - Change the name of a folder by tapping "Edit", then tapping on the
       folder name in the list.


Rearranging Folders
===================

.. list-table::
   :widths: 1 99
   :class: imglist

   * - |move icon|
     - You can change the order that folders are listed: tap "Edit", then grab
       the folder by the grippy texture on the right and drag it into the new
       position.

.. tip::

   You can change the name of the "Unfiled Barcodes" folder, but you can not
   move or delete it.


Deleting Folders
================

.. list-table::
   :widths: 1 99
   :class: imglist

   * - |red minus|
     - Delete folders from the list by tapping "Edit" and using the red
       "minus" that appears in front of the folder.  Deleting a folder also
       deletes all barcodes saved in that folder.

.. tip::

   To quickly delete a single folder without using "Edit", just *swipe* your
   finger across it in the list.

.. important::

   Delete operations can not be undone - once you confirm the deletion, the
   data is gone!


Deleting *Everything*
=====================

.. list-table::
   :widths: 1 99
   :class: imglist

   * - |clear icon|
     - You can clear *all* of the data saved by the app.  From the folder
       list, tap "Edit", then "Clear".

.. important::

   Delete operations can not be undone - once you confirm the deletion, the
   data is gone!
