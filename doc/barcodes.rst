********************

This is simply a list of the barcodes you have scanned:

   :width: 512px
   :height: 416px

The most recently scanned barcode is at the top.  Tap on a barcode to see more
:doc:`detail <detail>`, including any available links.

Using the toolbar you can also :ref:`email the full list of barcodes
<export-folder>`, :doc:`scan another barcode <scanning>` or :ref:`scan a saved
image <scan-image>`.


Deleting Barcodes
=================

.. list-table::
   :widths: 1 99
   :class: imglist

   * - |red minus|
     - Delete specific barcodes from the list by tapping "Edit" and using the
       red "minus" that appears in front of the barcode.

.. tip::

   To quickly delete a single barcode without using "Edit", just *swipe* your
   finger across it in the list.


Clearing the List
=================

.. list-table::
   :widths: 1 99
   :class: imglist

   * - |clear icon|
     - To quickly delete *all* of the barcodes from the list, tap "Edit", then
       "Clear".

.. important::

   Delete operations can not be undone - once you confirm the deletion, the
   data is gone!
